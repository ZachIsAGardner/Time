# Time

This is a pretty simple timer that I use to keep track of shift times at work. It's just a stopwatch, with a configurable start and end time. This way you know your current progress for the day.

See lines 94 and 95 for recommended configurable variables.
```
var startTime = "09:00:00";
var length = 8;
```

Once you have the settings as you like, open it in your favorite browser and marvel as time goes by.
