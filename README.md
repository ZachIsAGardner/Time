# Time

This is a pretty simple timer that I use to keep track of shift times at work. It's just a stopwatch, with a configurable start and end time. (It also doesn't stop). This way you know your current progress for the day.

See lines 94 and 95 in the "time.html" file for recommended configurable variables.
```
var startTime = "09:00:00";
var length = 8;
```
startTime being the start time in 24 hours format. (hh:mm:ss). length being the expected duration in hours.


Once you have the settings as you like, open the "time.html" file in your favorite browser and marvel as time goes by.
